      "- Location: On the near side, tucked into a shielded basin near the Serenitatis region. The city spreads around the towering Aurelian Spire, with domed neighborhoods sunk into the lunar crust and connected by climate-controlled tunnels.\n",
      "- Central landmark: The Aurelian Spire, a millennia‑tall, lattice‑work tower that houses the government, archives, and a vast data core. Its crown is a solar-lit crown that gathers starlight and radiates warmth into the city.\n",
      "- Governance: The Crescent Council, composed of representatives from major lunar settlements and orbital outposts, governs from the Crescent Assembly Hall inside the Spire. They operate under the Lunar Charter, balancing autonomy for lunar communities with a shared Moonwide framework.\n",
      "- Districts and feel: \n",
      "  - The Lumen Districts: glassy, sunlit domes where offices and homes glow with stored solar energy.\n",
      "  - The Subsurface Quarter: neighborhoods carved into the regolith, with hydroponic farms and life-support cores.\n",
      "  - The Ice Market: a shadowed ring of craters where water ice is mined and traded—an annual nocturnal festival happens here.\n",
      "  - The Archive Ring: libraries and holographic museums preserved in pressure vessels.\n",
      "- Economy and tech: a triad of power—the Suncatcher solar farms that blanket the far side and feed Lunaris Prime, water-ice extraction from permanently shadowed craters, and biotech labs growing food, medicines, and materials in closed-loop habitats. Construction relies on 3D-printed basalt and regolith composites.\n",
      "- Culture and daily life: a cosmopolitan blend of Earth-born communities and lunar-born settlers. Life is paced to the Moon’s long days and nights, with grav-lift transport, zero-g neighborhoods, and art that glows with energy stored in photon bricks. Night markets in the shadowed rims trade in art, music, and stories of Earth.\n",
      "- Notable features: The Echo Dome (communications hub), Lumen Park (a bioluminescent urban forest beneath a glass canopy), and the Tycho Ridge Observatory (a window on the planets and stars beyond).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like a different vibe—gritty, utopian, noir, or royal sci‑fi—tell me and I’ll tailor Lunaris Prime accordingly, or we can name the capital something else (e.g., Crescenta, Selene City, or Nova Lumen).\n"
